# M07-Assessment

All information for this assessment can be located under the 'Master' branch. This assessment was created using python 3.9.12('base': conda)

This is a working project of the Holiday Manager Assessment for M07. The Holiday Menu offers 5 options including:
1.) A holiday addition tool

2.) A holiday removal tool

3.) A tool to view holidays between 2020-2024
  3.1) An option to view weather for the current week.
 
4.) A tool to save any changes made to this project

5.) An exit tool to end the program session(with or without saving any changes)

The assessment can be found on the 'M07 Assessment-Revision.py' file. For the purposes of this project, there is a config.py file added as well, though the API for weather that was ysed did not require an API key, and so there was no sensitive information present.

Finally, the work.ipynb file contains many tests and proof of concepts that cane together in the creation of this project.
